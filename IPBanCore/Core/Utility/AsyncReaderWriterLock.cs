    /// Async compatible reader / writer lock based on https://stackoverflow.com/a/64757462/66372<br/>
    /// it doesn't have a lot of protection, so keep its usage simple i.e. blocks where try/finally can be used and no recursion can happen<br/>
    /// How it works:<br/>
    ///  - in general, a reader/writer lock allows any amount of readers to enter the lock while only a single writer can do so. While the writer holds the lock, no reader can hold the lock<br/>
    ///  - 2 semaphores + a count of readers in the lock are used to provide the above guarantees<br/>
    ///  - to guarantee no new readers or writers can enter the lock while a writer is active, a write semaphore is used<br/>
    ///    - both readers and writers acquire this semaphore first when trying to take the lock<br/>
    ///    - readers release the semaphore just after acquiring the read lock, so more readers can enter the lock (so technically acquiring of readers locks do not happens in parallel)<br/>
    ///  - to guarantee the writer does not enter the lock while there are still readers in the lock, a read semaphore is used<br/>
    ///    - both the writer and the first reader acquire this semaphore when trying to take the lock. They do it *after* they hold the write semaphore<br/>
    ///    - the last active reader holding the lock, releases the read semaphore. Note it does not need to be the reader that acquired it first.<br/>
    ///    - to track a reader acquiring/releasing a lock is the first/last one, a reader count is tracked when acquiring/releasing the read lock.<br/>
    ///  - cancellation tokens are supported so that readers/writers can abort while waiting for an active writer to finish its job.<br/>
